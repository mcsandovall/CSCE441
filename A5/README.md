# Highest Task 5 fully and Task 6 
Task 6 implemtes the differed rendering and the load of the 4 texture buffers which are usable. 

Instruction for deferred rendering
- In order to test the deferred rendering you can copy and paste the code from the drender.cpp file into the main and change the pass2_frag file fragment colors
- The code is all commented out in order to let the main render correctly
- I left the code all the way until task 5 in the main since it is the one that fully works and tas 6 is not fully implemented
Progress in task 6:
    The 4 texture buffers are loaded and fully usable with all the shapes
    However i was not able to incorporate the light component as the bling phong shader
    The rendering happens in a cube
