Howdy, this repository is a compilation of the assigmentes I completed thtroughout the course.

# Compilation
Each assigment has to be compiled on its own. The compilation does require previous installation of cmake and visual studio or Xcode for mac. 

Once you found youself in the directory of the repository run the following commands:
  $ mkdir build && cd build && cmake -G Xcode ..

The code will generate in the build directory and you can access it from there
